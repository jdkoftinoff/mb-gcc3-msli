<h1 class="settitle">Installing GCC: Old documentation</h1>
<h1 align="center">Old installation documentation</h1>

   <p>Note most of this information is out of date and superseded by the
previous chapters of this manual.  It is provided for historical
reference only, because of a lack of volunteers to merge it into the
main manual.

   <p>Here is the procedure for installing GCC on a GNU or Unix system.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>If you have chosen a configuration for GCC which requires other GNU
tools (such as GAS or the GNU linker) instead of the standard system
tools, install the required tools in the build directory under the names
<code>as</code>, <code>ld</code> or whatever is appropriate.

     <p>Alternatively, you can do subsequent compilation using a value of the
<code>PATH</code> environment variable such that the necessary GNU tools come
before the standard system tools.

     </p><li>Specify the host, build and target machine configurations.  You do this
when you run the <code>configure</code> script.

     <p>The <dfn>build</dfn> machine is the system which you are using, the
<dfn>host</dfn> machine is the system where you want to run the resulting
compiler (normally the build machine), and the <dfn>target</dfn> machine is
the system for which you want the compiler to generate code.

     <p>If you are building a compiler to produce code for the machine it runs
on (a native compiler), you normally do not need to specify any operands
to <code>configure</code>; it will try to guess the type of machine you are on
and use that as the build, host and target machines.  So you don't need
to specify a configuration when building a native compiler unless
<code>configure</code> cannot figure out what your configuration is or guesses
wrong.

     <p>In those cases, specify the build machine's <dfn>configuration name</dfn>
with the <code>--host</code> option; the host and target will default to be
the same as the host machine.

     <p>Here is an example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          ./configure --host=sparc-sun-sunos4.1
          </pre>

     <p>A configuration name may be canonical or it may be more or less
abbreviated.

     <p>A canonical configuration name has three parts, separated by dashes. 
It looks like this: <code></code><var>cpu</var><code>-</code><var>company</var><code>-</code><var>system</var><code></code>. 
(The three parts may themselves contain dashes; <code>configure</code>
can figure out which dashes serve which purpose.)  For example,
<code>m68k-sun-sunos4.1</code> specifies a Sun 3.

     <p>You can also replace parts of the configuration by nicknames or aliases. 
For example, <code>sun3</code> stands for <code>m68k-sun</code>, so
<code>sun3-sunos4.1</code> is another way to specify a Sun 3.

     <p>You can specify a version number after any of the system types, and some
of the CPU types.  In most cases, the version is irrelevant, and will be
ignored.  So you might as well specify the version if you know it.

     <p>See <a href="#Configurations">Configurations</a>, for a list of supported configuration names and
notes on many of the configurations.  You should check the notes in that
section before proceeding any further with the installation of GCC.

        </ol>

   <h2><a name="Configurations"></a>Configurations Supported by GCC</h2>

   <p>Here are the possible CPU types:

   <blockquote>
1750a, a29k, alpha, arm, avr, c<var>n</var>, clipper, dsp16xx, elxsi, fr30, h8300,
hppa1.0, hppa1.1, i370, i386, i486, i586, i686, i786, i860, i960, ip2k, m32r,
m68000, m68k, m6811, m6812, m88k, mcore, mips, mipsel, mips64, mips64el,
mn10200, mn10300, ns32k, pdp11, powerpc, powerpcle, romp, rs6000, sh, sparc,
sparclite, sparc64, v850, vax, we32k. 
</blockquote>

   <p>Here are the recognized company names.  As you can see, customary
abbreviations are used rather than the longer official names.

   <blockquote>
acorn, alliant, altos, apollo, apple, att, bull,
cbm, convergent, convex, crds, dec, dg, dolphin,
elxsi, encore, harris, hitachi, hp, ibm, intergraph, isi,
mips, motorola, ncr, next, ns, omron, plexus,
sequent, sgi, sony, sun, tti, unicom, wrs. 
</blockquote>

   <p>The company name is meaningful only to disambiguate when the rest of
the information supplied is insufficient.  You can omit it, writing
just <code></code><var>cpu</var><code>-</code><var>system</var><code></code>, if it is not needed.  For example,
<code>vax-ultrix4.2</code> is equivalent to <code>vax-dec-ultrix4.2</code>.

   <p>Here is a list of system types:

   <blockquote>
386bsd, aix, acis, amigaos, aos, aout, aux, bosx, bsd, clix, coff, ctix, cxux,
dgux, dynix, ebmon, ecoff, elf, esix, freebsd, hms, genix, gnu, linux,
linux-gnu, hiux, hpux, iris, irix, isc, luna, lynxos, mach, minix, msdos, mvs,
netbsd, newsos, nindy, ns, osf, osfrose, ptx, riscix, riscos, rtu, sco, sim,
solaris, sunos, sym, sysv, udi, ultrix, unicos, uniplus, unos, vms, vsta,
vxworks, winnt, xenix. 
</blockquote>

<p>You can omit the system type; then <code>configure</code> guesses the
operating system from the CPU and company.

   <p>You can add a version number to the system type; this may or may not
make a difference.  For example, you can write <code>bsd4.3</code> or
<code>bsd4.4</code> to distinguish versions of BSD.  In practice, the version
number is most needed for <code>sysv3</code> and <code>sysv4</code>, which are often
treated differently.

   <p><code>linux-gnu</code> is the canonical name for the GNU/Linux target; however
GCC will also accept <code>linux</code>.  The version of the kernel in use is
not relevant on these systems.  A suffix such as <code>libc1</code> or <code>aout</code>
distinguishes major versions of the C library; all of the suffixed versions
are obsolete.

   <p>If you specify an impossible combination such as <code>i860-dg-vms</code>,
then you may get an error message from <code>configure</code>, or it may
ignore part of the information and do the best it can with the rest. 
<code>configure</code> always prints the canonical name for the alternative
that it used.  GCC does not support all possible alternatives.

   <p>Often a particular model of machine has a name.  Many machine names are
recognized as aliases for CPU/company combinations.  Thus, the machine
name <code>sun3</code>, mentioned above, is an alias for <code>m68k-sun</code>. 
Sometimes we accept a company name as a machine name, when the name is
popularly used for a particular machine.  Here is a table of the known
machine names:

   <blockquote>
3300, 3b1, 3b<var>n</var>, 7300, altos3068, altos,
apollo68, att-7300, balance,
convex-c<var>n</var>, crds, decstation-3100,
decstation, delta, encore,
fx2800, gmicro, hp7<var>nn</var>, hp8<var>nn</var>,
hp9k2<var>nn</var>, hp9k3<var>nn</var>, hp9k7<var>nn</var>,
hp9k8<var>nn</var>, iris4d, iris, isi68,
m3230, magnum, merlin, miniframe,
mmax, news-3600, news800, news, next,
pbd, pc532, pmax, powerpc, powerpcle, ps2, risc-news,
rtpc, sun2, sun386i, sun386, sun3,
sun4, symmetry, tower-32, tower. 
</blockquote>

<p>Remember that a machine name specifies both the cpu type and the company
name. 
If you want to install your own homemade configuration files, you can
use <code>local</code> as the company name to access them.  If you use
configuration <code></code><var>cpu</var><code>-local</code>, the configuration name
without the cpu prefix
is used to form the configuration file names.

   <p>Thus, if you specify <code>m68k-local</code>, configuration uses
files <code>m68k.md</code>, <code>local.h</code>, <code>m68k.c</code>,
<code>xm-local.h</code>, <code>t-local</code>, and <code>x-local</code>, all in the
directory <code>config/m68k</code>.
