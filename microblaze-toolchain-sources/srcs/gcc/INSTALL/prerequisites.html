<h1 class="settitle">Prerequisites for GCC</h1>
GCC requires that various tools and packages be available for use in the
build procedure.  Modifying GCC sources requires additional tools
described below.

<h3 class="heading"><a name="TOC0"></a>Tools/packages necessary for building GCC</h3>

     <dl>
<dt>ISO C90 compiler
     <dd>Necessary to bootstrap the GCC package, although versions of GCC prior
to 3.4 also allow bootstrapping with a traditional (K&amp;R) C compiler.

     <p>To make all languages in a cross-compiler or other configuration where
3-stage bootstrap is not performed, you need to start with an existing
GCC binary (version 2.95 or later) because source code for language
frontends other than C might use GCC extensions.

     <br><dt>GNAT
     <dd>
In order to build the Ada compiler (GNAT) you must already have GNAT
installed because portions of the Ada frontend are written in Ada (with
GNAT extensions.)  Refer to the Ada installation instructions for more
specific information.

     <br><dt>A "working" POSIX compatible shell, or GNU bash
     <dd>
Necessary when running <code>configure</code> because some
<code>/bin/sh</code> shells have bugs and may crash when configuring the
target libraries.  In other cases, <code>/bin/sh</code> or even some
<code>ksh</code> have disastrous corner-case performance problems.  This
can cause target <code>configure</code> runs to literally take days to
complete in some cases.

     <p>So on some platforms <code>/bin/ksh</code> is sufficient, on others it
isn't.  See the host/target specific instructions for your platform, or
use <code>bash</code> to be sure.  Then set <code>CONFIG_SHELL</code> in your
environment to your "good" shell prior to running
<code>configure</code>/<code>make</code>.

     <p><code>zsh</code> is not a fully compliant POSIX shell and will not
work when configuring GCC.

     <br><dt>GNU binutils
     <dd>
Necessary in some circumstances, optional in others.  See the
host/target specific instructions for your platform for the exact
requirements.

     <br><dt>gzip version 1.2.4 (or later) or
     <dd><dt>bzip2 version 1.0.2 (or later)
     <dd>
Necessary to uncompress GCC <code>tar</code> files when source code is
obtained via FTP mirror sites.

     <br><dt>GNU make version 3.79.1 (or later)
     <dd>
You must have GNU make installed to build GCC.

     <br><dt>GNU tar version 1.12 (or later)
     <dd>
Necessary (only on some platforms) to untar the source code.  Many
systems' <code>tar</code> programs will also work, only try GNU
<code>tar</code> if you have problems.

</dl>

<h3 class="heading"><a name="TOC1"></a>Tools/packages necessary for modifying GCC</h3>

     <dl>
<dt>autoconf versions 2.13 and 2.57
     <dd><dt>GNU m4 version 1.4 (or later)
     <dd>
Necessary when modifying <code>configure.in</code>, <code>aclocal.m4</code>, etc. 
to regenerate <code>configure</code> and <code>config.in</code> files.  Most
directories require autoconf 2.13 (exactly), but <code>libiberty</code>,
<code>fastjar</code>, <code>libstdc++-v3</code>, <code>libjava/libltdl</code>, and <code>gcc</code>
require autoconf 2.57 (exactly).

     <br><dt>automake versions 1.4-gcj and 1.7.9
     <dd>
Necessary when modifying a <code>Makefile.am</code> file to regenerate its
associated <code>Makefile.in</code>.

     <p>Much of GCC does not use automake, so directly edit the <code>Makefile.in</code>
file.  Specifically this applies to the <code>gcc</code>, <code>intl</code>,
<code>libf2c</code>, <code>libiberty</code>, <code>libobjc</code> directories as well as any
of their subdirectories.

     <p>The <code>libstdc++-v3</code>, <code>libjava/libltdl</code>, and <code>fastjar</code>
directories require automake 1.7.9.  However, the Java directories, which
include <code>boehm-gc</code>, <code>libffi</code>, <code>libjava</code>, and <code>zlib</code>,
require a modified version of automake 1.4 downloadable from
<a href="ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/java/automake-gcj-1.4.tar.gz">ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/java/automake-gcj-1.4.tar.gz</a>.

     <br><dt>gettext version 0.12 (or later)
     <dd>
Needed to regenerate <code>gcc.pot</code>.

     <br><dt>gperf version 2.7.2 (or later)
     <dd>
Necessary when modifying <code>gperf</code> input files, e.g. 
<code>gcc/cp/cfns.gperf</code> to regenerate its associated header file, e.g. 
<code>gcc/cp/cfns.h</code>.

     <br><dt>expect version ???
     <dd><dt>tcl version ???
     <dd><dt>dejagnu version ???
     <dd>
Necessary to run the GCC testsuite.

     <br><dt>autogen version 5.5.4 (or later) and
     <dd><dt>guile version 1.4.1 (or later)
     <dd>
Necessary to regenerate <code>fixinc/fixincl.x</code> from
<code>fixinc/inclhack.def</code> and <code>fixinc/*.tpl</code>.

     <p>Necessary to run the <code>fixinc</code> <code>make check</code>.

     <p>Necessary to regenerate the top level <code>Makefile.in</code> file from
<code>Makefile.tpl</code> and <code>Makefile.def</code>.

     <br><dt>GNU Bison version 1.28 (or later)
     <dd>Berkeley <code>yacc</code> (<code>byacc</code>) is also reported to work other
than for java.

     <p>Necessary when modifying <code>*.y</code> files.

     <p>Necessary to build GCC during development because the generated output
files are not included in the CVS repository.  They are included in
releases.

     <br><dt>Flex version 2.5.4 (or later)
     <dd>
Necessary when modifying <code>*.l</code> files.

     <p>Necessary to build GCC during development because the generated output
files are not included in the CVS repository.  They are included in
releases.

     <br><dt>Texinfo version 4.2 (or later)
     <dd>
Necessary for running <code>makeinfo</code> when modifying <code>*.texi</code>
files to test your changes.

     <p>Necessary to build GCC documentation during development because the
generated output files are not included in the CVS repository.  They are
included in releases.

     <br><dt>TeX (any working version)
     <dd>
Necessary for running <code>texi2dvi</code>, used when running
<code>make dvi</code> to create DVI files.

     <br><dt>cvs version 1.10 (or later)
     <dd><dt>ssh (any version)
     <dd>
Necessary to access the CVS repository.  Public releases and weekly
snapshots of the development sources are also available via FTP.

     <br><dt>perl version 5.6.1 (or later)
     <dd>
Necessary when regenerating <code>Makefile</code> dependencies in libiberty. 
Necessary when regenerating <code>libiberty/functions.texi</code>. 
Necessary when generating manpages from Texinfo manuals. 
Used by various scripts to generate some files included in CVS (mainly
Unicode-related and rarely changing) from source tables.

     <br><dt>GNU diffutils version 2.7 (or later)
     <dd>
Necessary when creating changes to GCC source code to submit for review.

     <br><dt>patch version 2.5.4 (or later)
     <dd>
Necessary when applying patches, created with <code>diff</code>, to one's
own sources.
